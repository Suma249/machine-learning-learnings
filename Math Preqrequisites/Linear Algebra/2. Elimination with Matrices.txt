an elimination if it succeeds it gets the answer, and normally it does succeed.

all key ideas will get expressed as matrices

we have 3 linear equations with 3 unknowns
x+2y+z=2, 3x+8y+z=12, 4y+z=2 -> these 3 equations can be represented as Ax=b

first step pf elimination is, will multiply first equation with a proper number so that it can be substracted from equation 2
with the purpose to knock out x part that is to eliminate the x
A= 1 2 1                                                                                          1 2 1
   3 8 1  -> muktiplying equation 1 by 3 and subtractibg the equation 2 by equation 1 will give ->0 2 -2
   0 4 1                                                                                          0 4 1

next step of elimination, in the first step we got 0 at row 2 and column 1 and in the next step it should be a 0 at row 3 and column 1 but we already have 0 at that position
now we have to wipe out te position row 3 and colum 2 -> 2 times of second equation subtracted by third equation -> 1 2 1   b= 2
                                                                                                                    0 2 -1     6
                                                                                                                    0 0 5     -10
lets call this matrix as U, which is for upper triangle
whole purpose of elimination is to get U from A.
pivots in the matrix are 1,2 and 5 nd these pivotes cant be 0

in what sitations we could have failed like we failed to come up with pivotes as non zero?
if first pivot row 1 and column 1 is zero, in this case we can exchange the rows(i.ew whenver there is a 0 in pivot positioon, will exchange the rows)
b=augmente matrix

back substituition

we got x+2y+z=2, 2y-2z=6and 5z=-10 as our final system of linear equations with elimination method when we solved for pivots
with this we will get z=-2, y=1 and x=2

back substition: simple step to solve the equations in reverse order because the system is triangular

matrices
[ 1 2 7 ](1*3)[- - -]        1* row1
              [- - -]     -> + 2*row2
              [- - -](3*3)   + 7*row3

matrix times the column is a column

[1 2 1]
[3 8 2]
[0 4 1] 
 subtract 3*equation 1 frpm equation 2, gives below matrix
[1 2 1]
[0 2 -2]
[0 4 1], by mutiplying above matrix with which matrix we will get this matrix?
we can get it by multiplying the matrix with [1 0 0]
                                             [-3 1 0]
                                             [0 0 1] and let this matrix be e

step2: subtract 2*row 2 from row 3
